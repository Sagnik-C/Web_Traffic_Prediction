The EDA has been performed on 3 aspects of the dataset:
A) traffic generated from each access type
B) traffic generated from each site
C) traffic generated by the top pages from each site

Inferences:

From (A):
1) A spike is observed in the number of views for desktop access during July-August 2016
2) The number of views from desktop access seems to have an upward trend
3) A spike in the number of views was observed for "mobile-web" users during December 2016
4) There was an uptrend in the number of views from "mobile-web" access during July-2015 to February-2016

From (B):
1) The data from the sites is non-stationary
2) 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'ja', 'ru', 'zh' refer to different languages
3) 'en', 'er' seem to have an uptrend in the number of views
4) 'es' shows periodic uptrend and downtrend in the number of views, the views are especially low during Dec-Jan (holidays?)
5) Implemented arema without an acf/pacf analysis. Used some guessed values of p and q for arima.

From (C);
1) 'MediaWiki' saw an unusual spike in traffic during June 2016
2) 'Special: Search_commons' seems to be unifrom with no trend; however there was a spike in traffic during Aug-Oct 2015
3) 'Wikipedia: Portada_es' saw an unusual spike in traffic during February 2016; otherwise it shows a downtrend
4)  For ease of fitting and plotting applied the arima plot with p=10, d=1, q=1. Obtained the p and q values after analyzing the pacf and acf plots and taking the most frequent number of required lags
